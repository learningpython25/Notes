The **Sieve of Eratosthenes** is a simple and fast way to find all prime numbers up to a number `n`.

You start by writing down all numbers from 2 to `n`. The idea is to go through the list and repeatedly cross out the multiples of each prime number you find.

* Begin with 2, the first prime. Cross out all multiples of 2 (except 2 itself).
* Move to the next uncrossed number — that’s the next prime (3) — and cross out all its multiples.
* Keep repeating this: for each new number that hasn’t been crossed out, cross out its multiples.
* Stop when you've reached a number whose square is greater than `n`.

The numbers that are not crossed out at the end are the prime numbers.

It’s efficient because it skips non-prime numbers early and only needs to mark each composite number once using its smallest prime factor.


### Primes with looping


```python
import math

def primes(n: int) -> tuple[list[int], int]:
    counter = 0    
    result = []
    
    for num in range(2, n):
        
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, math.isqrt(num) + 1):
            counter += 1
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            result.append(num)
    return result, counter

n = 10000

primes, counter = primes(n)
print("Counter with brute force: ", counter, " Total primes: ", len(primes))
print(primes)
```

### Primes: Sieve of Eratosthenes

```python
import math

def primes_seive(n: int) -> tuple[list[int], int]:
    counter = 0
    nums = [0]*(n+1)    
    
    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
        if nums[i] == 0:
            for multiple in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                counter += 1
                nums[multiple] = 1
                
    primes = [x for x in range(2, n + 1) if nums[x] == 0]
    return primes, counter

n = 10000

primes, counter = primes_seive(n)
print("Counter with Primes Sieve: ", counter, " Total primes: ", len(primes))
print(primes)
```
