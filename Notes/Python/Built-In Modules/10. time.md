[Python time module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

The `time` module provides various time-related functions to work with timestamps, delays, and system clock information.

---

## 1. Importing the module

```python
import time
```

---

## 2. Core Concepts

* The `time` module deals mainly with **time in seconds** since the **Epoch** (Unix timestamp).
* Epoch (Unix timestamp) is **January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC**.
* Time values are usually floats representing seconds with fractions (sub-second precision).

---

## 3. Key Functions

### 3.1 time.time()

* Returns current time in seconds since the Epoch as a floating point number.

```python
print(time.time())  # 1685637600.123456 (example output)

# Variations: calling multiple times shows increasing values
print(time.time())  # 1685637601.234567
print(time.time())  # 1685637602.345678
```

---

### 3.2 time.sleep(seconds)

* Suspends (delays) execution for the given number of seconds.

```python
print("Start")
time.sleep(2)  # pause for 2 seconds
print("End")  # prints after 2 seconds delay
```

* `seconds` can be a float for sub-second sleep, e.g., `time.sleep(0.5)` pauses for half a second.

---

### 3.3 time.localtime(\[secs])

* Converts a time expressed in seconds since the Epoch to a `time.struct_time` in local time.
* If no argument, current local time is used.

```python
t = time.localtime()
print(t)  
# time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=10, tm_min=30, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=152, tm_isdst=1)

# Using a specific timestamp:
print(time.localtime(0))  
# time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0)
```

---

### 3.4 time.gmtime(\[secs])

* Like `localtime()` but returns time in UTC.

```python
print(time.gmtime())
# time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=14, tm_min=30, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=152, tm_isdst=0)
```

---

### 3.5 time.mktime(t)

* Converts a `time.struct_time` (local time) to seconds since the Epoch (inverse of `localtime`).

```python
t = time.localtime()
secs = time.mktime(t)
print(secs)  # float, current time in seconds
```

---

### 3.6 time.strftime(format\[, t])

* Formats a `time.struct_time` or current time to a readable string according to `format`.

```python
print(time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))  
# 2025-06-01 10:30:00  (example output)

# Format examples:
print(time.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y", time.localtime()))
# Sun, 01 Jun 2025
```

---

### 3.7 time.strptime(string, format)

* Parses a string representing a time according to `format`, returns a `time.struct_time`.

```python
t = time.strptime("2025-06-01 10:30:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(t)
# time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=10, tm_min=30, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=152, tm_isdst=-1)
```

---

### 3.8 time.perf\_counter()

* Returns the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, useful for timing code.
* High-resolution timer, includes time elapsed during sleep.

```python
start = time.perf_counter()
time.sleep(1)
end = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Elapsed: {end - start:.4f} seconds")  # Around 1.0 seconds
```

---

### 3.9 time.process\_time()

* Returns CPU time (user + system) used by the current process.
* Does **not** include time elapsed during sleep.

```python
start = time.process_time()
for i in range(1000000):
    pass
end = time.process_time()
print(f"CPU time used: {end - start:.4f} seconds")
```

---

### 3.10 time.thread\_time()

* Returns CPU time for the current thread (Python 3.7+).

---

## 4. time.struct\_time

* A named tuple with 9 attributes:

  * `tm_year` (e.g. 2025)
  * `tm_mon` (1–12)
  * `tm_mday` (1–31)
  * `tm_hour` (0–23)
  * `tm_min` (0–59)
  * `tm_sec` (0–61) — leap seconds allowed
  * `tm_wday` (0–6, Monday=0)
  * `tm_yday` (1–366)
  * `tm_isdst` (Daylight Saving Time flag)

---

## 5. Edge Cases & Caveats

* `time.sleep()` may sleep longer than requested due to OS scheduling.
* Leap seconds may cause `tm_sec` to be 60 or 61.
* Timezone and DST affect `localtime()`, but `gmtime()` is UTC.
* `time.time()` can jump backward/forward if system clock is changed.
* Use `perf_counter()` or `process_time()` for accurate timing, not `time.time()`.

## 6. Examples with output and variations

```python
print(time.time())  # e.g., 1685637600.123456

print(time.localtime())
# time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=10, tm_min=30, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=152, tm_isdst=1)

print(time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
# 2025-06-01 10:30:00

print(time.sleep(1))  # pauses program for 1 second

print(time.perf_counter())  # high-resolution timer
```
