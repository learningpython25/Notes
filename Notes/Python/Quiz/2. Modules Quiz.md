###### 1. What is a module in Python?
1. A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. It usually has a `.py` extension and allows you to reuse code across multiple programs.

###### 2. How do you import a module in Python?
- `import math`

###### 3. How do you import only a specific function or variable from a module?
- `from math import sqrt`

###### 4. How do you give a module an alias while importing?
- `import numpy as np`

###### 5. What is the difference between `import module` and `from module import something`?
1. `import module` loads the whole module and requires qualified names (`module.name`).
2. `from module import something` brings specific names directly into your namespace.

###### 6. What is the purpose of `__name__ == "__main__"` in a Python module?
- It allows code to run only when the module is executed directly, not when it is imported.
###### 7. How can you list all currently loaded modules in a Python session?
- `import sys`
- `print(sys.modules.keys())`
###### 8. Where does Python look for modules during an import?
1. Python searches in the following order:
   * The current directory
   * Directories in `PYTHONPATH`
   * Standard library directories
   * Site-packages (third-party modules)
   
###### 9. How can you see all the functions and attributes in a module?
- `print(dir(math))`

###### 10. What is the difference between a module and a package in Python?
1. A **module** is a single `.py` file.
2. A **package** is a directory that contains a special `__init__.py` file and can contain multiple modules and sub-packages.
